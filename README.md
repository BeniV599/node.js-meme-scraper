# For the folder to have some good ol' dank memes in it, innit?

## TODO:

- Create CLI (Command Line Interface) app that scrapes the **current version** of that website:
  https://memegen-link-examples-upleveled.netlify.app/
- Save at least 10 images into a folder called "memes" within directory of the said new project
- Image files should be named with an according number leading with a zero, such as 01.jpg, 02.jpg & so on
- Avoid using "image scraper" or "image downloader" library
- Just break the tasks down into smaller steps
- Select libraries for each necessary step
- Run program sever times without any error
